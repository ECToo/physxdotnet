# Current State #

  * Some of the more important classes wrapped, still a far cry from the whole thing.

  * Included a small test application "XNAPhysX" to test the wrapper.

  * Recreated Lesson 101, 102, 103, 201, 202, 207, 208, 213 and 215 from the PhysX SDK in XNA using a custom debug renderer.

  * Currently capsules are NOT displayed in the debug renderer, you will be able to see everything if you start the Ageia Visual Debugger from the PhysX SDK before loading the sample.
