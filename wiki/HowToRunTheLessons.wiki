a) Download either the entire repository via SVN (including Library, PhysXLibraries and Samples)...

or...

b) Download the daily snapshot from the Downloads area.

c) Ensure the PhysX System Software (drivers) are installed. The current version (as of 24th January 2008) is 7.11.13 and is available from [http://www.ageia.com/drivers/drivers.html Ageia's website].

To compile the C++/CLI wrapper itself you will need to the PhysX SDK, but this is not required to run the samples since PhysXCPP.dll is provided in debug and release form in ./Library/[debug|release]. The SDK is available [http://www.ageia.com/developers/get_now.html here.]

d) Compile away!

Leave an issue on the issues area if you're having issues, it's early days.
